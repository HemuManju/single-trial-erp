# Single-Trial ERP Detection with EEGNet

This repository contains code and resources for detecting single-trial event-related potentials (ERPs) in EEG data using deep learning approaches, with a focus on error-related potentials (ErrPs). The primary dataset used is the [OpenNeuro ds005841](https://openneuro.org/datasets/ds005841/versions/1.0.0) dataset.

## About the Project

This project provides:
- Scripts for preprocessing EEG data in BIDS format
- Deep learning pipelines (e.g., EEGNet) for single-trial ERP detection
- Example Jupyter notebooks for reproducible analysis
- Tools for data exploration and visualization

The goal is to enable fast, transparent, and reproducible research on cognitive ERPs using open-source tools.
